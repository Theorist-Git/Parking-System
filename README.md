# Parking Management System

---

## Introduction

Parking is a significant issue in metro cities. Day by day, parking systems are evolving with new technologies to address this challenge. 

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective solution for parking management. The entire database is stored in a MySQL table named `ParkingSystem`, which keeps track of parking slot information, the duration a vehicle has been parked, and the associated payment. 

In addition to these features, the system tracks the total money collected over time and includes an extensive searching and reporting system.

The project is divided into four major components:
1. Data Addition
2. Data Modification
3. Searching
4. Reporting

Each component is further divided into menus for easy navigation.
